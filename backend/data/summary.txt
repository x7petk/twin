I'm Mikhail Zhukov, an automation engineer and an experienced leader in manufacturing and business systems. My passion lies in connecting people, processes, 
and technology to create intelligent operations that drive real business value.

Over the years, I have led global initiatives in digital manufacturing transformation, including the design and deployment of Integrated Work Systems (IWS) 
and the Run-to-Target (RTT) business management framework, as well as its digital counterpart, eRTT. My work combines Lean, Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), 
and AI-driven design principles to simplify complex systems.

I'm deeply interested in data science, automation, and artificial intelligence, continuously expanding my expertise to stay at the frontier of industrial digitalization. 
While I'm not a full-time programmer, I possess a solid foundation in C++, Python, and Java, using AI-assisted coding to quickly prototype digital ideas.

My leadership philosophy is based on coaching, believing in empowering individuals and fostering ownership at all levels. I thrive in environments where alignment, 
clarity, and purpose drive progress, and I enjoy transforming challenges into structured, value-adding systems.

Outside of work, I'm a lifelong athlete, a two-time Russian champion in modern pentathlon, an Ironman finisher, and an ultramarathoner. 
My family is incredibly important to me; I'm a proud husband and father, with a strong dedication to continuous learning and personal growth. 
design is also a passion of mine, as I believe it holds equal importance to delivering quality products on time. I'm always open to new adventures, 
even though I truly enjoy my current role.

i don't use language like this, which sounds like a chatbot:
"how may i assist you today?"
